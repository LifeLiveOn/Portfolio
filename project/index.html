            <p>Hello everyone! I'm Thanh, but you can call me Chase. My programming journey began in 2021, and it's been an exciting adventure ever since.</p>
            <p>&emsp;My fascination with computers started at age 7. I was intrigued by how everything worked seamlessly inside that little box <i class="fa fa-desktop"></i>, realizing it was the result of teamwork and brilliant minds.</p>
            <p>&emsp;Initially, my love for gaming <i class="fa-solid fa-gamepad"></i> overshadowed my interest in programming. However, as I took on more coding projects, I discovered a deeper connection to my work and its meaningful impact.</p>
            <p>&emsp;In 2022, I decided to study abroad in the US <i class="fa-solid fa-flag-usa"></i> to further enhance my skills and broaden my horizons. I enjoy diving into analyses, understanding how applications work, and continuously learning new technologies. Despite the ever-changing market landscape, my passion for programming remains unwavering.</p>
            <p>&emsp;Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope you enjoy exploring my stories and projects!</p>
